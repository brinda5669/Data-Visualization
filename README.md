# Data-Visualization
# 1.Project Introduction 
This Project involves the investigation of the datasets from Prosper loan data, get the insights from those datasets and visualize them. The main reason for choosing this dataset is that it is so much related to our daily lives. this is the prosper loan data set, which contains information about APR, Credit Score and related variables including borrower as well as lender information. This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others. This project is divided into 3 analytical segments which are Univariate Plots, Bivariate Plots, and Multivariate Plots.


# 2. Main Findings
 
This project summarizes the characteristics of different variables that can affect the loan status and to get some ideas about the relationships among multiple variables using summary statistics and data visualizations.
Since some of the column containing significant number of NAâ€™s i.e. missing values it had to be eliminated before exploring its relation with other variables. And in some cases instead of missing values it was replace with the mean values.
While conducting Univariate analysis of Occupation, IncomeRate, LoanStatus,BorrowerAPR, and ProsperScore,the following things were concluded:


1.The most listings of Borrower fall under 50000 dollars and decreases with the increase in income range.
2.The most borrowers are from some other occupation and professional. Looks like people doesnot really show up there actual Profession or Borrowing.
3. The most Loan Status are under 'Current' status.
4.The BorrowerAPR with the high count looks 0.36 which higher than the mean value and second highest count of APR is below mean value i.e. 0.2.
5. So the most borrower are with the low score.Higher the ProsperScore lower the chance to be borrower.


While doing the Bivariate and Miltivariate analysis the following things were concluded:
    
    
1.The Median value of the ProsperScore decreases as the decrease in the income level.
2.The BorrowerAPR and the ProsperScore has negative realtion higher the ProsperScore lower the BorrowerAPR will be.
3.The more the income the more the principal amount borrowed from Prosper but exceptional applies for the not employed or 0 dollar salaried.
